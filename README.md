	<h1>Patient Monitoring System</h1>
	<p>Description</p>
	<p>This is a patient monitoring system that uses deep learning techniques, such as ConvLSTM and LRCN, for video processing. The system has been deployed on a website using Streamlit, making it easy for medical staff to upload patient videos and receive result videos directly on the platform.</p>
	<p>Styling Methods</p>
	<p>The styling of the web application has been done using CSS and HTML. The CSS file is located in the static folder, while the HTML file is located in the templates folder.</p>
	<p>To make changes to the styling, simply open the style.css file and edit the appropriate CSS rules. To make changes to the structure of the web application, open the index.html file and make the necessary changes to the HTML markup.</p>
